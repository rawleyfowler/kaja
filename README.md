<b>Kata</b> is a Japanese word (型 or 形) meaning "form". It refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of martial arts movements made to be <b>practised alone</b>. It can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training. It is practised in Japanese martial arts as a way to memorize and perfect the movements being executed. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata). This, but Clojure.

This repo contains various problems, and their solutions using Clojure. Each problem has a brief explanation in the form of a `README` file, accompanied by the URL to where I found the problem.
